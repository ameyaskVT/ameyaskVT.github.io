Hello World !

Testing the blog by first post.

Will use the blog to post project related stuff, and to maintain an online journal of any important concept/application I come across.

This blog was created using Jekyll 2.5 . It is to be noted that the format of the blog post file names will be :-
"YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-my-post.md" (without the quotes).
