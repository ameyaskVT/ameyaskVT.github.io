Hello World. This is the first post on my github pages website. 
I will use the website to host details of my projects and I will also use the blog as an online journal for any interesting concepts I may have learned or applied recently.
The website was created using a Jekyll template I found online at - https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo.
