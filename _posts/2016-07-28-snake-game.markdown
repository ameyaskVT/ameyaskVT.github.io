Recently,I started learning the Processing package of JavaScript which is useful for drawing games and animations. Based on that, I decided to try implementing a basic version of the Snake video game popularised by the Nokia mobile phones of early 2000s. 

Here is a link to the game :- http://ameyaskvt.github.io/hosting_misc/snakeGame.html . 
And a link to the source code :- https://github.com/ameyaskVT/ameyaskVT.github.io/blob/master/hosting_misc/hello-web.pde .

At the time of making this post, the game has most of the basic features of a 1-stage Snake game. (It doesn't have bonus meal feature yet).

I have been following the Khan academy tutorial series on JavaScript programming for learning JS.
